# EasyTrip Bus Company Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is a simulation of the EasyTrip Bus Company's operations. It is designed to model the company's passenger arrivals, and bus movements. The simulation uses various data structures (Array List, Linked Chain Queue, Priority Queue, Heap, etc...) and algorithms to efficiently manage and process the data.

The project is divided into several components, each represented by a set of files. These components include the simulation of bus movements, passenger arrivals, and the overall operation of the bus company. The project also includes various utility files and data files that provide additional functionality and data for the simulation.

The simulation is designed to be flexible and can be configured to simulate different scenarios. This is done by adjusting the parameters in the data files. The output of the simulation is written to an output file, which provides a detailed log of the simulation.
